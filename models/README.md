# Models
This document describes the components like preprocessing, training and evaluation of the classification, topic modeling and text similarity models of the Natural language processing.

**classification** - Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.

**topic_modelling** - Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that's capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.

**text_similarity** - Text similarity has to determine how 'close' two pieces of text are both in surface closeness [lexical similarity] and meaning [semantic similarity].
