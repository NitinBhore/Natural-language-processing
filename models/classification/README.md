# Text classification 
This document describes the components like preprocessing, training and evaluation of the classification of Natural language processing. Text classification also known as text tagging or text categorization is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.

**app.py** Flask is a Python-based microframework used for deploying the classifier

**prediction.py** file used to get the prediction of the classifier model

**requirements.txt** file listing all the dependencies for the deployment of the classification

**task.py** file used to train the BERT classifier model

**Docker** The Docker file holds the information of the docker container for the classifier model
